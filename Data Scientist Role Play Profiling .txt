Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115 
v. Review = 10000 
vi. Checkin =  493
vii. Photo = 10000 
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10000 
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780 

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	select *  from user where id is null or name is null or review_count is null or yelping_since
is null or useful is null or funny is null or cool is null or fans is null
or average_stars is null or compliment_hot is null or compliment_more is null 
or compliment_profile is null or compliment_cute is null or compliment_list is null
or compliment_note is null or compliment_plain is null;

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:5 	avg: 3.708
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.0	max:	5.0	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select bus.city AS cities,count(rev.id) AS number_of_review

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? Yes


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? Yes
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Based on the results, we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the location of the business and their rating. The business that are probably located in the same neighbor have close rating. Also they have similar working hours. Moreover, the business that have longer working hours usually have higher rating. 

SQL code used for analysis:

	select bus.name,BUS.CITY, CAT.category,bus.starS,hour.hours,bus.review_count,bus.neighborhood,bus.postal_Code
FROM (BUSINESS BUS INNER JOIN category CAT
ON BUS.ID=CAT.BUSINESS_ID ) inner join hours hour on bus.id= hour.business_id
where BUS.CITY='Toronto'
group by bus.stars;

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Business which are still open have higher review count.
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
Business which are still open have better stars.

| Toronto Acupuncture Studio | Toronto | Acupuncture |   4.5 | Saturday|10:00-14:00 |           16 | Brockton Village |       1 |
+----------------------------+---------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+------------------+---------+
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

select bus.name,BUS.CITY, CAT.category,bus.starS,hour.hours,bus.review_count,bus.neighborhood,bus.is_open
FROM (BUSINESS BUS INNER JOIN category CAT
ON BUS.ID=CAT.BUSINESS_ID ) inner join hours hour on bus.id= hour.business_id
where BUS.CITY='Toronto'
group by bus.is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         The analysis is to find out what are the most successful businesses based on the business category.
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  In order to do this analysis, we will need data such as id, stars, and review count from the business table and category from category table. We will need to count the numbers of companies within each category, the average stars given by the consumers to see how they perform, and the total reviews given to see if the data is relevant and ensure it’s not biased.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
